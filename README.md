# Retwis

A port of [antirez/retwis](https://github.com/antirez/retwis) to NodeJS and Express.
(Yes, it is a very _old_ tutorial (2009), but fun to do in any case!)

## WIP

Under construction. This is me playing around with the [Redis Twitter clone tutorial](https://redis.io/topics/twitter-clone).

## Installing dependencies

The examples use `yarn` as I like it. You can also use `npm`.

```
yarn install
```

## Starting the server

```
yarn start
```

This will start the Express server on the default port: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000);
